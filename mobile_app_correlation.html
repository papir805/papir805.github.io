									<u>Background</u>
								</h3>
								<p>
									This article covers part 3 of the case study and is meant to detail my process as I check for a correlation between user attributes and user performance.  I'll create visualizations to check for signs of correlation and will use hypothesis testing to identify which user attributes, if any, are statistically significant predictors of a user's performance.  For those attributes, I'll quantify the size of the correlation using regression modeling.

														Information on whether a user is a subscriber and which category they fall in is in the users table, but information on point scores is in the event_performance table, so the two tables have to be joined before any investigation into correlation can happen. Because there may be userids in the users table who have never participated in a gaming event and thus have no entries in the event_performance table, a LEFT JOIN is needed to ensure all userids from the users table make it into the joined table.¬†
													</p>
													<p>
														Any userids that aren't found in the event_performance table would normally be assigned NULL values, but these users have no matching entries because they've never played in a gaming event. ¬†If they've never played in a gaming event, then their yearly point total should be 0, and COALESCE is used to make this happen.¬†

									<h4>
										Visualizing the Yearly Point Distribution
									</h4>
									<p>
										These boxplots compare the yearly point totals for subscribers against non-subscribers, as well as users in category A against those in category B against those in category C. ¬†Userids that had yearly point totals less than $Q_1 - 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$ or more than $Q_3 + 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$ are considered outliers and are represented by the circles that lay beyond the whiskers. ¬†Pay extra close attention to these, as they'll become important soon.¬†

													<p>
														The first boxplot shows roughly the same spread of point totals regardless of whether a user is a subscriber or not. The medians are close, and the overall distribution of point totals is pretty similar. My initial impression is that there's either no correlation or a weak correlation between whether a user is a subscriber and their yearly point totals.
													</p>
													<p>
														On the other hand, the second boxplot shows more noticeable differences between the three categories: A, B, and C. Category A and B have fairly similar performance, although category A has a little less variability than category B. However, category C is quite different and is the most interesting.
													</p>
													<p>
														The plot reveals point totals for category C are skewed right and look to be the strongest performing group. ¬†Very few users in this category have yearly point totals that are negative, and therefore these users must be consistently contributing to the human team's bottom line.
													</p>
													<p>
														Additionally, category C contains the users with the 9 highest point totals of the year, and it seems unlikely for that to be a coincidence. ¬†This can be seen in the graph, where the red line represents the 9th highest point total of the year. ¬†The nine players who scored at least that many points are represented by the colored circles to the right.
													</p>
												</section>
											</div>
										</div>
										<br>
										<p>
											While nothing is definitive yet, it's starting to look like there could be some correlation between a user's attributes and yearly point totals.  Category seems like it would have the strongest correlation, but subscriber may be important too.
										</p>
									</div>
									<h4>
										Scatter Plots
									</h4>
									<p>
										The following scatter plots take the boxplots from above and add more granularity.  Now, the point scores for every single one of the 1,100 users in the dataset can be seen.

														Subscriber looks about the same as before. ¬†There are similar spreads of point totals regardless of whether a user is a subscriber or not, and there doesn't appear to be much, if any, correlation.
													</p>
													<p>
														Pearson's correlation coefficient is calculated at 0.1551, indicating a weak positive correlation. ¬†While the correlation shouldn't be discounted yet, it may still be worthwhile. Hypothesis testing will be performed later to check for statistical significance.

														This scatterplot tells the same story as before but makes it even clearer. ¬†Category C has by far the highest yearly point totals, while categories A and B are pretty similar to each other. Occasionally, there are those in category B who score highly too, but it's heavily dominated by users in category C.
													</p>
													<p>
														Pearson's correlation coefficient would be nice to measure the strength of the correlation here, but it can't be calculated on categorical data. ¬†However, it can be calculated after encoding the categorical data using dummy variables.

														Using Pandas, I encoded category as a dummy variable and calculated the correlation with yearly point totals. ¬†Category C has a correlation of 0.5365, indicating a moderately positive correlation, and is the strongest correlation out of all the user attributes. ¬†Category A and category B both have similar correlations of -0.2429 and -0.2147, respectively, indicating weak negative correlations.
													</p>
													<p>
														Everything observed so far is promising evidence of some correlation between user attributes and user performance; however, the relationship that's observed in the dataset could simply be the result of a fluke and not necessarily because a correlation truly exists. ¬†To be certain beyond a reasonable doubt, hypothesis testing can be used.

														In order to avoid the dummy variable trap, regression has to be performed using all but one level of the dummy variable, which acts as the baseline level for comparison. ¬†In this model, category A represents the baseline level for the dummy variable, and any coefficients of the model must be interpreted relative to that category.
													</p>
												</section>
											</div>
										</div>
										<br>
										<p>
											The model will have the following form: $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_3$, where $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ correspond to the coding scheme:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												$x_1 = \left\{\begin{aligned} 
													1 &\text{ if userid is a paid subscriber} \\
													0 &\text{ if userid is not a paid subscriber}
												\end{aligned} \right.$
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												$x_2 = \left\{\begin{aligned} 
													1 &\text{ if userid is in category B} \\
													0 &\text{ if userid is not in category B}
												\end{aligned} \right.$
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												$x_3 = \left\{\begin{aligned} 
													1 &\text{ if userid is in category C} \\
													0 &\text{ if userid is not in category C}
												\end{aligned} \right.$
											</li>
											<br>
										</ul>
									<p>
										After plugging in the coefficients generated by the summary output, the model looks like this: $\hat{y}=114.4202+7258.8017x_1+617.8321x_2+22002.3214x_3$.
									</p>
									<h4>
										Interpreting the Model
									</h4>
									<p>
										Understanding how to interpret the model will help understand the relationship between user attributes and user performance. ¬†When $x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$ are all set to 0, you have your baseline user, a non-subscriber, who is neither in category B nor in category C; therefore, they must be in category A. ¬†For this kind of user, the model's predicted yearly point total would simply be the constant 114.4202. ¬†
									</p>
									<p>
										If $x_2$ is set to 1 and all other variables remain 0, then this would represent a non-subscriber in category B.  For this kind of user, the predicted yearly point total would increase by the coefficient of 617.8321 points.  This indicates that, on average, non-subscribers in category B earn 617.8321 points more than non-subscribers in category A.  This echoes what was seen earlier regarding there not being much difference in point scores between users in these categories.
									</p>
									<p>
										When $x_3$ is set to 1 and all other variables remain 0, the user is a non-subscriber in category C. ¬†For this kind of user, the model would predict a yearly point total of 22,002.314 points higher than the baseline user. ¬†This is the largest coefficient of the model and emphasizes just how strong the performance of users in category C really is.
									</p>
									<p>
										When $x_1 = 1$, this indicates the user is a subscriber. ¬†Users of any category can be subscribers; therefore, regardless of the values of $x_2$ or $x_3$, $x_1$ could be set to one and "turned on". ¬†Turning on $x_1$ would increase the model's prediction of yearly point totals by its coefficient of 7258.8017, meaning that a subscribing user is predicted to earn that many points more than a non-subscribing user from the same category. ¬†Despite earlier identifying subscriber as having a weak correlation, it produces the second largest effect on predicted yearly point totals in this model and looks to be more important than was initially thought.
									</p>
									<h4>
										Conclusions
									</h4>
									<p>
										In summary, it seems as though the question of whether there's any correlation between user attributes and user performance has been answered. ¬†Both subscriber and category are statistically significant predictors of a user's performance as measured through their yearly point totals. ¬†The single best predictor is which category a user falls into, with category C being the most important; however, knowing whether a user is a subscriber or not is pretty important too.
