										<u>Section 1: Introduction to the Case Study</u>
								</h3>
								<p>
									This case study was given to me, and I was asked to use gaming data in order to identify which users score highest and whether there's any correlation between user attributes and user performance. I'm unfamiliar with the dataset, though, and don't know whether it's clean or not. Before checking for correlation, I'll need to inspect the dataset, perform cleaning if necessary, and then familiarize myself with it. I plan to approach the problem in three parts:
								</p>

									<li style="list-style: none;">
										<a href="mobile_app_data_cleaning.html">Part 1: </a>Import the data into a PostgreSQL database and perform cleaning as necessary.

										<a href="mobile_app_data_analysis.html">Part 2: </a>Import the data into a PostgreSQL database and perform cleaning as necessary.Explore the dataset and attempt to understand the game better, focusing on point totals as a measure of user performance.  Use SQL to query the dataset and Python to generate visualizations. 
										<!-- Establish user profiles based on performance, if possible. -->
									</li>
									<li style="list-style: none;">
										<a href="mobile_app_correlation.html">Part 3: </a>Import the data into a PostgreSQL database and perform cleaning as necessary.Use Python to perform hypothesis testing and identify which user attributes, if any, are correlated most strongly with user performance.  Use regression modeling to quantify any correlation found to be statistically significant.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									This article covers part 2 of the case study and is meant to detail my process as I perform an exploratory data analysis.  I'll familiarize myself with the dataset so that I can better look for correlation between user attributes and performance in part 3 of the case study.  I'll use point scores as a measure of user performance and hope to understand the dataset better by generating summary statistics and visualizations.

									<u>Section 2: Introduction to the Game</u>
								</h3>
								<p>
									The data comes from a mobile game produced by a gaming company that runs periodic gaming events. Gaming events last several hours and happen at most once a day. 
								</p>
								<p>
									During a gaming event, all players play cooperatively as the human team to earn points against an enemy team comprised of a network of AI bots. Players on each team win or lose points when they take certain actions in the game; however, the total point score of each team at the end of the gaming event is all that matters for the win condition. If the humans have more points when the event ends, then the humans win; otherwise, the enemy AI team wins.
								</p>
								<p>
									To entice users to continue playing, there are rewards for winning a gaming event, but to keep things interesting, there are also penalties for losing. When the human team wins, users win prizes based on a tiered system where higher tiers earn better prizes, and the point total at game end determines which tier's prizes are won. On the other hand, should the game end and the human team has a negative score, then all players are forced to take a penalty. Like prizes, penalties have a tiered structure too, which gets progressively more severe for worse and worse tiers.

														Each line in the table above needs to be calculated separately in the SQL query and joined together using UNION.  Because multiple rows in the event_performance table correspond to the same gaming event, DISTINCT is needed to identify how many unique dates are in the dataset.  Since there is at most one gaming event per day, the number of unique dates will reveal how many gaming events occurred over the year.  Lastly, to prevent integer division when calculating the participating_users_pct, one of the values in the quotient needs to be cast to type <i>NUMERIC</i>. 
													</p>
													<p>
														
													</p>
													<p>
														These summary stats show that over the course of a year, there were 147 gaming events, with 89.09% of the 1,100 unique users participating in at least one gaming event. ¬†With user participation so high and because gaming events occur on only 40.27% of the days in the year, <b> there is potential to hold additional gaming events throughout the year that will also see high user participation and are likely to be profitable as a result. </b>

										Two queries, the first grouping by subscriber and the second grouping by category, are needed to generate the data for the plot.  Using GROUP BY with COUNT(userid) will get the counts of each subgroup, but those will need to be divided by the total number of users in order to calculate the proportion of each subgroup.
									</p>
									<p>
										To do this, SUM(COUNT(userid)) OVER () is used.  Using OVER () tells SQL that the SUM should be performed as a window function and will therefore occur <i>after</i> the counts of each subgroup are calculated from the GROUP BY.  This ensures the SUM(COUNT(userid)) will add together the counts of each subgroup, thus giving the total count of all users that is needed to calculate the proportions.  Python's Matplotlib library is then used to create the bar chart.
									</p>
										<b><u>The bar chart reveals what kinds of user attributes are most common:</u></b>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Subscriber -  Most common value is 0, a non-subscriber, by a significant majority (81.7%).
											</li>
											<li>
												Category - Most common value is B (40.4%), but A isn't that far behind (37.4%).
											</li>
											<li>
												subscriber = 1 and category = C are the least common and have roughly the same proportions, 18% and 22% respectively.
											</li>

												<p>
													In order to group by month, EXTRACT, DATE_PART, or DATE_TRUNC could be used, however, to preserve the month <i>and</i> year, DATE_TRUNC is necessary. Once DATE_TRUNC has been performed, the results are cast to the DATE type, which cuts off the hour, min, sec, etc., parts of the timestamp. Lastly, the GROUP BY is performed, and the total number of points and number of unique users per month are calculated.
												</p>
												<p>
													The first graph shows all months have a sum of points greater than 0, which provides further evidence that overall, most users are successfully contributing to winning gaming events. Late summer and early fall have the only three months that performed better than average: July, August, and September, with August being the best-performing month by a large margin.
												</p>

									</div>
									<br>
									<p>
										Looking at the second graph, these late spring and summer months tell an interesting story. While July to August had the largest increase in point performance of the year and the 3rd largest increase in user participation, August to September had a <b>huge</b> drop in point performance despite having the second largest increase in user participation. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, the largest increase in user participation occurs between January and February, corresponding to the second-largest increase in point performance all year. This large influx of users early on in the year improves point performance initially, but the several months following February dropped and then stagnated with below-average point scores.
									</p>
									<p>
										Outside of these best performing late spring and summer months, total points don't show much variation and tend to hover slightly below average. Points earned between February and July remain fairly consistent, and the number of participating users is fairly consistent too. However, despite October, November, and December having the largest number of participating users all year, each of those months performed worse than average.
									</p>
									<p>
										Intuitively, it makes sense that the number of participating users would correlate to the total number of points scored. The graphs above show there is some evidence for this theory; for instance, January had the lowest number of participating users all year and also had the lowest point performance. On the other hand, there are some inconsistencies too; August had the best point performance, yet it was 5th in terms of participating users.
									</p>
									<b><u>What are the biggest takeaways?</u></b>
									<ol>
										<li>
											Total points earned show some seasonality, and identifying ways to increase user performance during early spring, late fall, and throughout the winter months could be important to fostering growth and generating revenue.
										</li>
										<li>
											Total points earned also show some connection to the number of participating users. Consequently, identifying why the number of users increased rapidly between January and February at the start of the year, or during the late spring and early summer months, could be important to driving future growth and, in turn, additional revenue.

														Using GROUP BY and HAVING again, I separate the users into those who have positive yearly point totals and those who have negative yearly point totals and store the results in a CTE. ¬†Afterwards, I can aggregate the two groups separately by month to find the total monthly points scored for each group.

														Earlier, in the summary statistics part of this analysis, it was noted that 71% of users had positive yearly point totals, while 29% of users had negative yearly point totals.  In the graph above, the blue line represents users with positive yearly point totals and closely mimics the previous graph, where the strongest performance tended to occur during the late spring and summer months; however, the orange line represents users with negative yearly point totals and tells a new part of the story.

									<br>
									<p>
										While June and August were the worst months for these users, they're the exception to the rule. In general, for most of the year, there's little variation in the number of points scored by users with negative yearly point totals, and their point scores stay fairly consistent. This could suggest that these users consistently score poorly and are just not very good at the game. They're likely to be the ones at the very bottom of the leaderboards.

										It's also worth noting that June and August had small spikes in point totals going in opposite directions for each kind of user. For users with a positive yearly point total, the graph spikes upward, corresponding to the 1st and 3rd largest increases in point totals, while the graph for users with negative yearly point totals moves down, corresponding to the 1st and 2nd most points lost over the year. It seems unusual that both the best users would score more AND the worst users would score less at the same time, and it might be worth investigating to better understand if there was a cause.

  														Because it was noticed earlier that total points earned per month showed some seasonality, it's worth looking at performance for each season: spring, summer, fall, and winter.  Using a CASE statement and EXTRACT, I can label each row in the event_performance table by season and store the results in a CTE.  I can then perform a GROUP BY to find the total number of points per season and per hour.

										The graph shows hourly totals of points earned for each season and reveals a few interesting things. To begin, gaming events only occur in the evening hours, starting as early as hour 16 and going as late as hour 20. In spring and summer, the general trend is that more points are earned in earlier hours, while in fall and winter, more points are earned in later hours. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Furthermore, spring and summer have no points earned during hours 19 and 20, yet in fall and winter, most points are earned in hour 19. Regardless of the season, the trend is that more points are earned hour by hour until reaching a peak, and then points earned steadily decline afterwards.
									</p>
									<p>
										Understanding these trends could be used to target gaming events during times of the day that will see more user engagement and more points earned based on the season. <b>In spring and summer, earlier hours should be preferred, whereas in fall and winter, later hours should be preferred.  Because there is no participation in hours 19 and 20 during spring and summer, it might be worth investigating how to increase user participation during those times of the day.</b>

									<h4>Total Points Per Gaming Event</h4>

													<p>
														Using DATE_TRUNC, I can truncate the timestamp to the day and then perform a GROUP BY to find the total number of points earned per day. ¬†<b>Since there's at most one gaming event per day, this translates to the total number of points per gaming event. </b>
													</p>
													<p>
														The graph shows the total points earned for each of the 147 gaming events present in the dataset. The vast majority of point totals lie above 0, further confirming what was seen earlier: most gaming events end with the users winning. However, despite frequently winning, many of these point totals are below average, and consequently, users would have earned minimal prizes.

										On the other hand, virtually all gaming events found during the months of June through September have above-average performance, with the most successful day of the year happening on September 13th. This isn't too surprising, as it was found earlier in the analysis that the late spring and summer months had the best performance throughout the year. Earlier, it was also noted that one day had the worst performance with -257,483 points earned, which appears to correspond to July 11th. The plot reveals that the second-worst-performing day of the year occurs just a day before, on July 10th. It would be worth spending time to understand what happened on June 10th, June 11th, and September 13th and why user performance was so extreme.

									<b><u>What are the biggest takeaways?</u></b>
									<ol>
										<li>
											They continue to reinforce the idea that increasing user participation and user performance outside of late spring and summer is important to foster growth and generate revenue.
										</li>
										<li>
											While the late spring and summer months consistently performed well, these months also had the two days that performed worst by a large margin. ¬†Understanding why there are such large extremes during these seasons could be helpful.

									<p>
										Now that I have a better understanding of the event_performance dataset and how users are performing in general, I'll start exploring how user attributes affect performance by incorporating the users dataset. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In <a href="mobile_app_correlation.html">part 3</a> of the project, I join these tables together to produce visualizations, perform hypothesis testing, and build regression models to check for and quantify any correlation between user attributes and user performance.
