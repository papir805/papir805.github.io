										Two queries, the first grouping by subscriber and the second grouping by country, are needed to generate the data for the plot.  Using GROUP BY with COUNT(userid) will get the counts of each subgroup, but those will need to be divided by the total number of users in order to calculate the proportion of each subgroup.
									</p>
									<p>
										To do this, SUM(COUNT(userid)) OVER () is used.  Using OVER () tells SQL that the SUM should be performed as a window function and will therefore occur <i>after</i> the counts of each subgroup are calculated from the GROUP BY.  This ensures the SUM(COUNT(userid)) will add together the counts of each subgroup, thus giving the total count of all users that is needed to calculate the proportions.  Python's Matplotlib library is then used to create the bar chart.

														Grouping by both subscriber and country and using the same SUM(COUNT(userid)) OVER () strategy from earlier, the proportions for each unique user profile can be calculated.  Python's statsmodels library is then used to create a mosaic plot for visualization.

														In the mosaic plot, the proportion between the area of each of the six smaller rectangles and the area of the larger rectangle corresponds to the proportions of each of the subgroups 0A, 0B, 0C, 1A, 1B, and 1C to all users.

														Using GROUP BY and HAVING, I can split up the event_performance table and then join it back together using UNION, labeling users based on user type during the process.  Users with a positive yearly point total, users with a negative yearly point total, or users with a yearly point total of 0 are identified, and then I employ the same SUM(COUNT()) OVER () strategy from earlier to get the proportion of each user type and graph using Matplotlib.
													</p>
													<p>
														Since the goal of a gaming event is to earn points for your team, segmenting users by their yearly point totals offers some insight into which players are regularly contributing towards winning a game, versus those who detract from it.  The vast majority of players (71.4%) have yearly point totals that are positive and, broadly speaking, are successfully helping win games.

														Using GROUP BY and HAVING again, I separate the users into those who have positive yearly point totals and those who have negative yearly point totals and store the results in a CTE.  Afterwards, I can aggregate the two groups separately by month to find the total monthly points scored for each group.

														Earlier, in the summary statistics part of this analysis, it was noted that 71% of users had positive yearly point totals, while 29% of users had negative yearly point totals.

										While June and August were the worst months for these users, they're the exception to the rule. In general, for most of the year, there's little variation in the number of points scored by users with negative yearly point totals, and their point scores stay fairly consistent. This could suggest that these users consistently score poorly and are just not very good at the game. They're likely to be the ones at the very bottom of the leaderboards.
									</p>
									<p>
										It's also worth noting that June and August had small spikes in point totals going in opposite directions for each kind of user. For users with a positive yearly point total, the graph spikes upward, corresponding to the 1st and 3rd largest increases in point totals, while the graph for users with negative yearly point totals moves down, corresponding to the 1st and 2nd most points lost over the year. It seems unusual that both the best users would score more AND the worst users would score less at the same time, and it might be worth investigating to better understand if there was a cause.

									<h3>
										Section 3: Recommendations
									</h3>
									<br>
									<h4>
										User Engagement Team
									</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Gaming events occur on only 40.27% of the days in the year and user participation is fairly high, with 88.18% of users participating in at least one gaming event. <b>There is potential to hold additional gaming events throughout the year that are likely to bring in additional revenue. </b>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Identify why the massive spike in player activity occurred from July to August</b> and adapt any findings <b>to increase engagement in March through June or October through December</b>, times that are historically slow.
										</li>
										<li>
											Investigate why August to September saw a huge drop in player activity despite having 76 more participating users than the previous month.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Find ways to stimulate user engagement outside of July through September.  Months like October, November, and December have the highest number of participating users
											but some of the lowest in-game activity</b>.  It's possible many of these players are only logging on for short periods of time or logging on and going inactive, both indicating a lack
											of interest in the game and signals potential customer churn.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>
										Marketing Team
									</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Identify what promotions ran during January and February or July through September</b>, months where the number of users increased rapidly.  Use any findings <b>to time new campaigns at other times of the year.</b>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Charge more for ads between 4 p.m. - 6 p.m. in spring and summer and between 6 p.m. - 8 p.m. in fall and winter.</b>  These are the hours that see the most in-game activity.
										</li>
